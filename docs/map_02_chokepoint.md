*Note: The bridge is 4 tiles wide, making it hard to block with just 1 unit. It requires a line.*

## Enemy Units (Iron Legion)
Total Enemies: Infinite Reinforcements (Waves)

| ID | Class | Lvl | Weapon | HP | Str | Skl | Spd | Def | Res | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| E1 | Cavalier | 3 | Iron Lance | 24 | 7 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 1 | High Mov |
| E2 | Cavalier | 3 | Iron Sword | 24 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 4 | 1 | High Mov |
| E3 | Archer | 3 | Iron Bow | 20 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 3 | 1 | Behind Cavs |
| E4 | Knight | 4 | Steel Lance | 28 | 9 | 5 | 2 | 10 | 1 | Mini-Boss |

## Waves
*   **Start**: 2 Cavaliers (Lance), 1 Archer.
*   **Turn 2**: 2 Cavaliers (Sword).
*   **Turn 4**: 1 Knight, 2 Archers.
*   **Turn 6**: 2 Cavaliers, 1 Mage (Thunder).
*   **Turn 7**: ALL OUT CHARGE (3 Cavs, 1 Knight).

## Strategy Guide
*   **Formation**: Kaelen cannot hold the 4-tile bridge alone. The team must use the terrain.
*   **The Forts**: There are two forts on the flanks. Putting units there gives healing and defense.
*   **Chokepoint**: The bridge exit is the danger zone.
*   **Elara's Role**: Her Rapier is critical here. Cavaliers and Knights are weak to it. She can one-shot the Knight if she doubles or crits.
*   **Lyra**: Needs to nuke the Knight (Low Res).
*   **Thorne**: Focus on enemy Archers and Mages.

## Balance Notes
*   **Escalation**: Introduction of Cavaliers means enemies close the gap instantly. Players can't kite.
*   **Difficulty**: The wide bridge forces the player to commit at least 2-3 units to the front line, exposing the squishies (Lyra/Thorne) if they aren't careful.
*   **Elara's Rapier**: This map is designed to make Elara feel like a god with her Rapier.
