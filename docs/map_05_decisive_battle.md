*Note: The players start in the MIDDLE, surrounded by the Boss (who is invincible) and 4 Guardians in the corners. They must push OUTWARD to the Pylons.*

## The Gimmick: The Rite of Iron
*   **Valerius's Shield**: Valerius takes 0 damage and cannot be critically hit until all 4 Pylons are destroyed.
*   **The Pylons**: Each Pylon has 20 HP. Destroying one weakens Valerius (removes a buff) and spawns reinforcements.
*   **The Guardians**: Each corner is guarded by an elite enemy tailored to be countered by one of your units.

| ID | Name | Class | Weapon | HP | Str | Skl | Spd | Def | Res | Counter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TL | Sage | Sage | Bolting | 30 | 15 | 12 | 10 | 4 | 12 | **Thorne** (Longbow/Res) |
| TR | Hero | Hero | Brave Sword | 35 | 14 | 18 | 16 | 10 | 4 | **Kaelen** (Tank/Lance) |
| BL | General| General | Spear | 40 | 16 | 10 | 5 | 18 | 2 | **Lyra** (Magic) |
| BR | Sniper | Sniper | Silver Bow | 32 | 13 | 20 | 14 | 8 | 5 | **Elara** (Speed/Close Range) |
| Boss | Valerius | Emperor | Siegfried | 50 | 20 | 15 | 12 | 20 | 10 | **Team Effort** |

*Note: "Siegfried" is a custom sword (1-2 Range, Def +5).*

## Strategy Guide
1.  **The Split**: The team must split up.
    *   **Top Left (Sage)**: Has Bolting (Long range magic). Thorne needs to snipe him or silence him.
    *   **Top Right (Hero)**: Fast and hits twice. Kaelen can wall him.
    *   **Bottom Left (General)**: Physical wall. Lyra eats him for breakfast.
    *   **Bottom Right (Sniper)**: Dangerous at range. Elara can close the gap and dodge.
2.  **The Boss**: While they do this, Valerius is moving. He will chase the nearest unit. You have to kite him while destroying the pylons.
3.  **The Climax**: Once Pylons are down, the shield breaks. Valerius is enraged (Stats up?). The team converges on the center for the final blow.

## Balance Notes
*   **Escalation**: The ultimate test of multitasking and individual unit mastery.
*   **Tension**: Kiting an invincible boss while fighting elite 1v1s is high stress.
*   **Narrative**: Fits the theme of a small elite squad dismantling a larger force through precision.
