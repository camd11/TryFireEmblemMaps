# Fire Emblem: The Sapphire Guard - Design Document

## Campaign Overview
**The Sapphire Guard** is a 5-map mini-campaign focusing on a squad of 4 elite units escaping a coup and striking back at the usurper. The campaign is designed to test tactical flexibility, with each map introducing new layers of complexity.

## The Roster
1.  **Elara (Blade Lord)**: The Leader. High Avoid, Rapier user. Critical for taking down armored/cavalry bosses.
2.  **Kaelen (General)**: The Wall. Physical tank who can hold chokepoints indefinitely but struggles against magic and terrain.
3.  **Lyra (Sage)**: The Nuke. High magic damage and healing, but extremely fragile. The answer to high-defense enemies.
4.  **Thorne (Sniper)**: The Specialist. Long-range chip damage and vision utility. Essential for taking out high-threat targets safely.
