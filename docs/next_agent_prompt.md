# Prompt for Next Agent

Please create a new Fire Emblem scenario for me using the system described in [docs/agent_guide.md](cci:7://file:///C:/Users/camd1/OneDrive/Documents/TryFireEmblemMaps/docs/agent_guide.md:0:0-0:0).

**Theme:** "Classic Fire Emblem Escape" - A small band of loyal knights escaping a fallen kingdom.

**Core Requirements:**
1.  **Objective:** Every single map must have the objective **"Escape"** (arrive at a specific zone).
2.  **Narrative:** The King has fallen. A royal guard, a young noble, and their retainers must flee the capital and cross the border while being pursued by the usurper's army.
3.  **Maps:** Create a 5-map run.
    *   **Map 1:** Castle Escape. Fleeing the throne room/courtyard.
    *   **Map 2:** City Streets. Navigating the burning city to reach the gates.
    *   **Map 3:** Forest Pursuit. Losing the pursuers in the woods.
    *   **Map 4:** Mountain Pass. A dangerous climb to the border.
    *   **Map 5:** The Bridge. Holding the bridge at the border until everyone crosses.
4.  **Units:** Design a party of 4 distinct units (e.g., a Paladin/Jagen, a Lord/Noble, a Pegasus Knight, a Mage).

**Action:**
Read [docs/agent_guide.md](cci:7://file:///C:/Users/camd1/OneDrive/Documents/TryFireEmblemMaps/docs/agent_guide.md:0:0-0:0) to understand the JSON schema, then overwrite [viewer/src/data/units.json](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/camd1/OneDrive/Documents/TryFireEmblemMaps/viewer/src/data/units.json:0:0-0:0) and `viewer/src/data/maps.json` with this new campaign.
