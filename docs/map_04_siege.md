## Enemy Units (Iron Legion - Garrison)

| ID | Class | Lvl | Weapon | HP | Str | Skl | Spd | Def | Res | Drops |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| E1 | Knight | 8 | Steel Lance | 32 | 11 | 7 | 3 | 12 | 2 | Door Key |
| E2 | Archer | 7 | Longbow | 24 | 8 | 9 | 7 | 5 | 3 | - |
| E3 | Mage | 7 | Elfire | 22 | 4 | 8 | 8 | 3 | 8 | Chest Key |
| E4 | Mercenary| 8 | Steel Sword | 26 | 9 | 10 | 10 | 6 | 2 | - |

## Mechanics
*   **Doors**: There are 4 doors. E1 drops a Door Key (1 use). There might be another key in a chest or held by another enemy.
*   **Executioner**: An enemy Thief spawns on Turn 3 near the Prisoners and moves to kill them. Player must rush or snipe him through the wall (Thorne!).
*   **Chests**: Contain a **Killer Lance** (for Kaelen) and a **Physic Staff** (for Lyra - ranged healing).

## Strategy Guide
*   **Split Up**: Sending Kaelen/Lyra to the main door (Center) while Elara/Thorne go for the Prisoners (Right) might be necessary.
*   **Thorne's Moment**: The "Executioner" Thief is behind a wall. Thorne can shoot over walls (Standard FE logic). If he has a Longbow, he can save the prisoners without opening the door.
*   **Resource Management**: You have limited keys. You might need to buy some in the prep screen (if shop exists) or rely on drops.
*   **The Boss**: A General. Extremely high Defense (15). Physical units will tink him. Lyra (Mage) is the only reliable damage source. Kaelen can tank him, but can't hurt him.

## Balance Notes
*   **Escalation**: Multi-tasking. The player can't just deathball. They have to manage side objectives.
*   **Boss**: The General is a hard counter to 3/4 of the team. This forces Lyra to be the MVP, protected by the others.
